- Examples:

  - social network - relationship between poeple
  - transportation - conectivity between locations
  
- networks useful for modeling relationship between entitites
- what entities/nodes are important?

- optimize transportation between cities?
- find communities between networks

#### Network structure:

- nodes
- edges

- together form graph

- can have metadata


### Types of graphs:

social graphs - undirected graphs - no directionality associated with them
- line with no arrows

Bidirected graph - twitter - one follows another user but that person maynot follow back

multiple edges allowed -  bike sharing stations - trips between

in multigraph - instead of 3 edges - add one edge with weight = 3
nodes are connected to themselves - bike sharing same location

### network visualization

- matrix plot

  - nodes are rows
  
### Clique: group of nodes completely connected to one another

- simplest clique - edge
- simplest complex clique - edge
- maximal clique = that cannot be extended by adding an extra node
